# Hypersonic Airplane

This work is the test for approval in Dynamic Control System discipline.

## Problem Specification

To capacitance and resistence study, uses the equation below. The equation establish the control of hypersonic airplane, according to the book Modern Control Systems by DORF, R. C.

$$ G(s) = \frac{10(s+6)}{s(s+1)(s+a)}, \forall a \in Z $$

When aplies a unitary step, this equation tend to infinity, its prove in your inversal Laplace. Therefore, realocate the poles is necessary. Realocating "a" on imaginary axis, its possible to discard it. So:

$$ G(s) = \frac{10(s+6)}{s(s+1)}, \forall a \in Z $$
